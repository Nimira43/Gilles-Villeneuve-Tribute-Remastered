        <h1>The Legend of Gilles Villeneuve</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Gilles Villeneuve (born 18th January 1950) started his career in snowmobile racing, winning the 1974 World Championship Snowmobile Derby, and then moved into single seaters, winning the US and Canadian Formula Atlantic championships in 1976, before being offered a drive in Formula One with the McLaren team at the 1977 British Grand Prix. He was taken on by reigning world champions Ferrari for the end of the season and drove for the Italian team from 1978 until 1982. He won six Grand Prix races in a short career at the highest level. In 1979, he finished second in the championship to teammate Jody Scheckter.</p>
        <h2>Early Impressions</h2>
        <p>After Villeneuve impressed James Hunt by beating him and several other Grand Prix stars in a non-championship Formula Atlantic race in 1976, Hunt's McLaren team offered Villeneuve a Formula One deal for up to five races in a third car during the 1977 season. Villeneuve made his debut at the 1977 British Grand Prix, where he qualified 9th in McLaren's old M23, separating the regular drivers Hunt and Jochen Mass who were driving newer M26s. In the race he set fifth fastest lap and finished 11th after being delayed for two laps by a faulty temperature gauge. The British press coverage of Villeneuve's performance was generally complimentary. </p>
        <em><strong><center>"Anyone seeking a future World Champion need look no further than this quietly assured young man."</strong><br> - John Blunsden, commenting in The Times</center></em><br>
        <p>Despite this McLaren decided not to continue with Villeneuve for the following year and he was left with no solid options for 1978, Rumours circulated that Villeneuve was one of several drivers in whom Ferrari's team was interested, and in August 1977 he flew to Italy to meet Enzo Ferrari, who was immediately reminded of Tazio Nuvolari, the pre-war European champion. </p>
        <em><strong><center>"When they presented me with this 'piccolo Canadese', this minuscule bundle of nerves, I immediately recognised in him the physique of Nuvolari and said to myself, let's give him a try."</strong><br> - Enzo Ferrari</center></em><br>
        <p>Ferrari was satisfied with Villeneuve's promise after a session at Ferrari's Fiorano test track and signed him to drive for Ferrari in the last two races of 1977, as well as the full 1978 season.</p>
        <em><strong><center>"If someone said to me that you can have three wishes, my first would have been to get into racing, my second to be in Formula 1, my third to drive for Ferrari."</strong><br> - Gilles Villeneuve</center></em>
        <h2>Ferrari</h2>
        <h3>1978</h3>
        <p>Early in the season, he started on the front row at the United States West Grand Prix at Long Beach and finished second on the road at the Italian Grand Prix. He ran second at the United States Grand Prix before his engine failed and at the season-ending Canadian Grand Prix Villeneuve scored his first win. To date, he remains the only Canadian to win the Canadian Grand Prix.</p>
        <h3>1979</h3>
        <p>Villeneuve was joined by Jody Scheckter in 1979 after Carlos Reutemann moved to Lotus. Villeneuve won three races during the year and briefly led the championship after winning back to back races in Long Beach and Kyalami. However, the season is mostly remembered for Villeneuve's intense wheel-banging duel with Ren√© Arnoux in the last laps of the 1979 French Grand Prix, managing to hold him off to secure second place. </p>
        <em><strong><center>"I tell you, that was really fun! I thought for sure we were going to get on our heads, you know, because when you start interlocking wheels it's very easy for one car to climb over another."</strong><br> - Gilles Villeneuve </center></em>
        <p>At the Dutch Grand Prix a slow puncture collapsed Villeneuve's left rear tyre and put him off the track. He returned to the circuit and limped back to the pit lane on three wheels, losing the damaged wheel on the way. On his return to the pit lane Villeneuve insisted that the team replace the missing wheel, and had to be persuaded that the car was beyond repair.</p> 
        <p>Villeneuve might have won the World Championship by ignoring team orders to beat Scheckter at the Italian Grand Prix, but chose to finish behind him, ending his own championship challenge. The pair finished first and second in the championship, with Scheckter beating Villeneuve by just four points. </p>
        <p>If Gilles legend was ever in doubt one of the most memorable moments in Formula 1 history happened at the season-ending United States Grand Prix. During the extremely wet Friday practice session Villeneuve set a time variously reported to be either 9 or 11 seconds faster than any other driver.</p>
        <em><strong><center>"I scared myself rigid that day. I thought I had to be quickest. Then I saw Gilles's time and... I still don't really understand how it was possible. Eleven seconds!!!"</strong><br> - Jody Scheckter, who was second fastest</center></em>
        
        <h3>1981</h3>
        <em><strong><center>"That car...had literally one quarter of the downforce that, say Williams or Brabham had. It had a power advantage over the Cosworths for sure, but it also had massive throttle lag at that time. In terms of sheer ability I think Gilles was on a different plane to the other drivers. To win those races, the 1981 GPs at Monaco and Jarama, on tight circuits, was quite out of this world. I know how bad that car was."</strong><br> - Harvey Postlethwaite, designer of the 1982 Ferrari 126C2 that won the Constructors' Championship, speaking about the 1981 Ferrari 126C</center></em>
        <p>After 1980, where Ferrari gave Villeneuve a terrible car, the new 1981 season saw Ferrari introduce their first turbocharged engined F1 car, the 126C, which produced tremendous power but was let down by its poor handling. Villeneuve was partnered with Didier Pironi who noted that Villeneuve "had a little family [at Ferrari] but he made me welcome and made me feel at home overnight. He treated me as an equal in every way."</p>
        <p> Villeneuve won two races during the season. At the Spanish Grand Prix Villeneuve kept five quicker cars behind him for most of the race using the superior straight-line speed of his car. After an hour and 46 minutes of racing Villeneuve led second-placed Jacques Laffite by only 0.22 seconds. Fifth-placed Elio de Angelis was only just over a second further back. </p>
        <p>At the 1981 Canadian Grand Prix Villeneuve damaged the front wing of his Ferrari and drove for most of the race in heavy rain with the wing obscuring his view ahead. There was a risk of being disqualified but eventually the wing detached and Villeneuve drove on to finish third with the nose section of his car missing.</p>
        <h3>1982</h3>
        <p>He was offered a deal by Ron Dennis to rejoin McLaren in 1982 which he rejected, being optimistic that Ferrari would be competitive. The first few races of the 1982 season saw Villeneuve leading in Brazil in the new 126C2, before spinning into retirement, and finishing third at the United States West Grand Prix before being disqualified for a technical infringement.</p> 
        <p>The Ferraris were handed an unexpected advantage at the San Marino Grand Prix as Formula 1 politics saw some teams boycott the race leaving Renault as Ferrari's only serious opposition. With Renault driver Prost retiring from fourth place on lap 7 followed by his teammate Arnoux on the 44th lap Ferrari seemed to have the win guaranteed.</p>
        <p> In order to conserve fuel and ensure the cars finished the Ferrari team ordered both drivers to slow down. Villeneuve believed that the order also meant that the drivers were to maintain position but Pironi passed Villeneuve. A few laps later Villeneuve re-passed Pironi and slowed down again, believing that Pironi was simply trying to entertain the Italian crowd. On the last lap Pironi passed and aggressively chopped across the front of Gilles in Villeneuve corner and took the win. Villeneuve was irate as he believed that Pironi had disobeyed the order to hold position. Meanwhile, Pironi claimed that he had done nothing wrong as the team had only ordered the cars to slow down, not maintain position. </p>
        <em><strong><center>"I think it is well known that if I want someone to stay behind me and I am faster, then he stays behind me."</strong><br> - Gilles Villeneuve after the race </center></em>
        <h3>1982 Belgian Grand Prix</h3>
        <p>On May 8, 1982, during the last moments of qualifying for the 1982 Belgian Grand Prix, Villeneuve tried to improve on his lap time. At this time Pironi had set a time one-tenth of a second faster than Villeneuve for sixth place. Some say Villeneuve had gone out to beat Pironi's time, still angered after what had happened at the last Grand Prix.</p>
        <p>He died after crashing with a slower car at race speed whilst trying to go faster. The accident came less than two weeks after the intense argument with Pironi.</p>
        <p> At the time of his death Villeneuve was extremely popular with fans becoming an iconic figure in the history of the sport. His son, Jacques Villeneuve, won the Indianapolis 500 and CART championships in 1995 and became Formula One World Champion in 1997.</p>
        <em><strong><center>"He was the craziest devil I ever came across in Formula 1... The fact that, for all this, he was a sensitive and lovable character rather than an out-and-out hell-raiser made him such a unique human being."</strong><br> - Niki Lauda.</em><br><br>
        <em><strong>"I will miss Gilles for two reasons. First, he was the most genuine man I have ever known. Second, he was the fastest driver in the history of motor racing. But he has not gone. The memory of what he has done, what he achieved, will always be there."</strong><br> - Jody Scheckter</center</em>
